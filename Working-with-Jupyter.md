## Abstract

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is a handy tool for working on data analysis tasks. We love it and design our models usually there before moving to production. It is a nice way do design your [Custom model](https://github.com/hastic/hastic-server/wiki/Custom-model).

## Exporting data

We recommend to use [grafana-data-exporter](https://github.com/CorpGlory/grafana-data-exporter) for getting subsets of your timeseries
